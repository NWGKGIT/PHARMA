# Pharmacy Management App

This is a simple pharmacy management app built with **React Native** and **Expo**. It uses **SQLite** for local database storage. The app helps you manage your pharmacy inventory, track product quantities, and keep an eye on expiration dates. It's still a work in progress, but the goal is to make it easy to organize and keep track of inventory in a small pharmacy setting.

Currently, the app lets you:

- Add, update, and delete inventory items
- See expiration dates for products
- Keep track of quantities on hand

Install all required libraries and dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install React Native, Expo, and other necessary dependencies.

### 4. Start the Development Server

Once dependencies are installed, start the Expo development server:

```bash
npx expo start
```
A new browser tab will open with a QR code.

### 5. Run on Your Mobile Device

- Open the Expo Go app on your mobile device.
- Scan the QR code from your browser or terminal using the appâ€™s QR code scanner.
