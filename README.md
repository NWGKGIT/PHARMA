# Pharmacy Management App

This is a simple pharmacy management app built with **React Native** and **Expo**. It uses **SQLite** for local database storage. The app helps you manage your pharmacy inventory, track product quantities, and keep an eye on expiration dates. It's still a work in progress, but the goal is to make it easy to organize and keep track of inventory in a small pharmacy setting.

Currently, the app lets you:

- Add, update, and delete inventory items
- See expiration dates for products
- Keep track of quantities on hand
